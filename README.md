# CNN Practical Sessions on CIFAR-10 and MNIST Datasets

Welcome to my repository where I have documented practical sessions on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** using Google Colab. This repository includes Jupyter Notebooks showcasing experiments and implementations of CNN models on the **CIFAR-10** and **MNIST** datasets.

---

## Overview

This repository contains:
- Hands-on CNN implementation notebooks.
- Model building, training, and evaluation for CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets.
- Observations and key insights from the experiments.

## Datasets

### 1. CIFAR-10
- A dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.
- Classes include airplanes, cars, birds, cats, deer, dogs, frogs, horses, ships, and trucks.

### 2. MNIST
- A dataset of 70,000 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9).

## Notebooks

### 1. **CIFAR-10 Practical Notebook**
- Data preprocessing.
- CNN architecture creation and customization.
- Training and evaluation on CIFAR-10 dataset.
- Visualization of training loss and accuracy.

### 2. **MNIST Practical Notebook**
- Data normalization and augmentation.
- Implementation of a simple CNN for digit recognition.
- Training, testing, and metrics evaluation.

## Requirements

To run the notebooks, you need:
- Python 3.7+
- Libraries:
  - TensorFlow/Keras
  - NumPy
  - Matplotlib
  - scikit-learn

You can install the dependencies using:
